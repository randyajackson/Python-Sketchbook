# Coded this way, a class with an abstract method cannot be instantiated (that is, we
# cannot create an instance by calling it) unless all of its abstract methods have been
# defined in subclasses

# Assignment (X = value)
# Makes names local by default: creates or changes the name X in the current local
# scope, unless declared global (or nonlocal in 3.X).

# Reference (X)
# Looks for the name X in the current local scope, then any and all enclosing functions,
# then the current global scope, then the built-in scope, per the LEGB rule.
# Enclosing classes are not searched: class names are fetched as object attributes
# instead.

# Because attributes are actually dictionary keys inside Python, there are really two ways
# to fetch and assign their valuesâ€”by qualification, or by key indexing:
# >>> X.data1, X.__dict__['data1']
# ('spam', 'spam')
# >>> X.data3 = 'toast'
# >>> X.__dict__
# {'data2': 'eggs', 'data3': 'toast', 'data1': 'spam'}
# >>> X.__dict__['data3'] = 'ham'
# >>> X.data3
# 'ham'
