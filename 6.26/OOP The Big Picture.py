#  For our code to qualify as
# being truly object-oriented (OO), though, our objects will generally need to also participate
# in something called an inheritance hierarchy.

# Two aspects of OOP prove useful here:

# Inheritance and Composition

# The __init__ method is known as the constructor

# At a fundamental level, classes are really just packages of functions and other names,
# much like modules

# bob = Employee() # Default behavior
# sue = Employee() # Default behavior
# tom = Engineer() # Custom salary calculator

# company = [bob, sue, tom] # A composite object
# for emp in company:
#  print(emp.computeSalary()) # Run this object's version: default or custom

#example of polymorphism
# code shouldnâ€™t care about
# what an object is, only about what it does
